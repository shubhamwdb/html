    <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San%C4%81tana_Dharma">Sanātana Dharma</a></b> <i>(Devanagari: सनातन धर्म, meaning "eternal dharma",</i> "eternal order")[1] is an endonym used by <u>Hindus to refer to Hinduism</u>. It refers to the “eternal” truth and teachings of Hinduism. It can also be translated as “the natural and eternal way to live". The term is used in Indian languages alongside the more common Hindu Dharma for Hinduism.[2][3] Sanatana Dharma can also denote the list of 'eternal' or absolute duties and practices</p>
<h3>Importance of Sanātana Dharma</h3>
    <div>In Sanskrit, Sanātana Dharma translates approximately to "eternal law" or, less literally, "eternal way."[5] In Pali, the equivalent term is Dhammo Sanātano (धम्मो सनन्तनो).[5] In Hindi, the Sanskrit tatsama dharm धर्म is being used as "religion"[6] (सनातन धर्म) roughly translates to "eternal religion".</div>
